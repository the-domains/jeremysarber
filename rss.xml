            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Enter To Win Four Free Bibles</h1><p>Item number four on my personal mission statement: Live with simplicity. I am constantly asking myself, "Do I need that?" I scrutinize the stuff I own, the apps on my phone, the way I use my time, and on it goes. I'm always trimming the fat and throwing away the excess.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6e67392e78ca33370846f191c0404ed9d997804e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>From the First Prayer of the Day to the Last</h1><p>My day begins with silent prayer and a cup of coffee. As my wife, a teacher, rushes around the house preparing to leave for school, I sit at the kitchen table waiting for my brain to come alive. Sometimes I scan news headlines on my phone, but never more than a few minutes.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/bb36f5eb8d1a0b7b8845634ec418d8d1e10baf07.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Choosing Modern Readability Over Shakespearian Prose</h1><p>His words sounded vaguely familiar. I recognized the substance of them, but not the form or style. My fourth-grade friend was reading a Bible passage I'd heard countless times only his version was different. I grew up using the KJV. My father used it. My church used it.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/140e75a9276154d65e057616f00e30062553c195.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Prospect of Being Wrong and the Insecurities That Follow</h1><p>This is part 5 in an ongoing series. Continued from "From Pride To Exclusivity To Swift Condemnation" All things considered, I doubt pride is the predominant cause of our refusal to question or διαλέγομαι (reason and discuss) traditions. It seems the more likely culprit is insecurity.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/075f5cbcb14e99ec39fbd56930f418c7921fbab6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Suppressing Our Inner Theologians For Clarity</h1><p>It is easy to get lost in the depths of theology, soteriology, eschatology, and perhaps a few other ologies. Sometimes we miss the beautiful simplicity of the message. The Bible is not exclusive to theologians. God did not inspire it to help us bulk up our official creeds.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d6c5ff0d3f700085c6386ff1061b2ab54593a457.jpg"></article>]]></description>
