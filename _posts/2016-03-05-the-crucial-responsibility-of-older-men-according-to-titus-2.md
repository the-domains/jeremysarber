# The Crucial Responsibility of Older Men According To Titus 2

> But as for you, teach what accords with sound doctrine. Older men are to be sober-minded, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness. Older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers or slaves to much wine. They are to teach what is good, and so train the young women to love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled, pure, working at home, kind, and submissive to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be reviled. Likewise, urge the younger men to be self-controlled. Show yourself in all respects to be a model of good works, and in your teaching show integrity, dignity, and sound speech that cannot be condemned, so that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us. 

Never before has training our young people in the church been so vital. As the morality of our world declines and our exposure to it increases, young people with their lack of wisdom, self-control, and naivety are easily influenced. Children are growing up at a slower rate than previous generations. They are often in their mid-twenties before they are independent adults. 

Are we providing the younger ones with the right foundation, education, and spiritual guidance they need to become God-honoring, Christ-following men and women? Do we realize this responsibility has been given not only to parents but every older, mature person in the church? 

## What Older Men Should Be 

Sober-Minded. We understand this word's most literal definition to be free of the effects of alcohol. It has a broader meaning as well. Older men should be clear-headed. Alcohol clouds the mind, lowers inhibitions, dulls the senses, and impairs judgment. But alcohol is not alone. 

Imagine the man so wrapped in his work that he fails to give any attention to Christ or his family. Imagine the man addicted to sports or some other form of entertainment. He can't tear himself away from the ballpark or TV. Imagine the man with no particular obsession but is perpetually distracted by the affairs of everyday life. 

Paul told the Corinthians, "Wake up from your drunken stupor, as is right, and do not go on sinning." Spiritual maturity requires a sharp mind focused on what actually matters. 

Dignified. Older men should be worthy of respect. This does not mean they must always be serious, lacking a sense of humor. But they should behave in an honest, respectable manner. 

It's a matter of reputation. When the apostles selected men to serve the poor widows of the church in Jerusalem, they said, "Brothers, pick out from among you seven men of good repute." 

Dignified men are poor in spirit, merciful, and pure in heart. They hunger and thirst for righteousness. They are peacemakers. This is how the world sees them, not to mention the church and their families. 

Self-Controlled. Titus was a pastor in Crete, a place full of decadence. Paul described the Cretans as "liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons." In contrast, men in the church are to be self-controlled or temperate. They are to be sensible, depriving themselves of carnal excess. 

This begins with wisdom and a sober mind. It extends to his behavior. He knows what is right and is able to make sound judgments. Furthermore, he has brought his flesh into subjection. 

Sound In Faith, Love, and Steadfastness. Older men have a healthy degree of faith, love, and steadfastness. Spiritual maturity is marked by a combination of all three. Paul commended the Thessalonians for this: 
> 
> We give thanks to God always for all of you, constantly mentioning you in our prayers, remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. 

Through all of their wisdom and experience, older men learn to trust in God completely. It is like nothing can disturb their peace. Calamity may destroy their lives, but they remark with a smile, "We know that for those who love God all things work together for good." 

Mature men have a firm grasp on the first and second greatest commandments: 
> 
> You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. 

These men are patient and kind. They do not envy or boast. They are not arrogant or rude. They're not interested in pleasing themselves. They're not irritable or resentful. They rejoice in the truth. 

These men also endure. With patience and hope, they persevere despite the temptations and trials of life. 

## What Older Men Should Teach 

It is not enough for older men to become the fully-developed disciples described in this passage. They also have a responsibility to proactively mentor the younger men in the church. First, they must "urge the younger men" with their words. Second, they must "be a model of good works." 

Ultimately, they are to teach young men to be self-controlled. This word is actually the verb form of sober-minded. It encompasses integrity, dignity, and sound speech. The KJV adds sincerity which is another word for integrity. 

This is important because it stifles the world's criticism of believers. The church of the living God is to be a pillar and foundation of the truth. We are the light of the world. We are ambassadors for Christ. Our words and actions should be expressions of the truth and accurate reflections of Jesus Christ. If so, our opponents can have nothing evil to say about us. 

As for our young men, we must teach them these things before the world's influence dominates their thinking. After all, they are, Lord willing, the future leaders of the church.
